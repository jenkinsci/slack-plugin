<div>
  <p>
    Enter the channel names or user ids to which notifications should be sent. Note that this can include names of
    channels OR channel id numbers, e.g. "#builds", and that multiple values may appear comma separated.
    While names are more readable, channel ids will not change over time and are therefore more resilient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thread support is available for slack APPs that handle requests using "chat.postMessage" method.
    Besides to the channel ID, thread_ts must be passed to the SlackRoom parameter, separated by a colon (:).
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    "chat.postMessage" endpoint could not handle `names of channels`, `channel id numbers` need to be used.
  </p>
  <p>
	This overrides the global setting.
