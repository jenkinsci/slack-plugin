# 1.8.1 release notes

This is a backport release which backports features originally intended for
slack-2.0 release.  This is meant as a nice fix for people missing critical
bugs.  Thanks [@Nooba](https://github.com/Nooba/) for taking the time to
backport all of the changes.  Since new features listed here will also be
included in the slack-2.0 release I'm not going to bother mentioning them in the
slack-2.0 release at all.

New Features:

- Allow simple markup formatting in custom messages. (#127)

UI Improvements:

- Improves custom message help text. (#97)

Bug fixes:

- Allow parallel builds. (#122)
- Use textarea for customMessage.  This allows custom messages to have new
  lines. (#103)
- Set test connection message color correctly. (#101)
- Fix publish to multiple rooms. Add unit tests. (#98, #100)
- Include custom message when changes are found. (#95)

  configured (#42, #90)

  (#64)

  Jenkins UI when it succeeds or fails to connect to the slack instance (#51,
  #81)

Improvements:

- Improve 'started' message with proper cause (#37)
- The separator for specifying posting to multiple slack channels is more
  robust.  It now allows spaces, commas, and semicolons as a separator (#56)
- Notifications start with full project name when using Cloudbees folders
  plugin.  This includes the folder and the project in the notification (#61)
- Search upstream causes when gathering commit list (#67)
- Change repeated failure message improvement with `Still Failing`.  Makes it
  easier to understand if it is the first or repeated failure in a build (#77)
- Add unit tests for `doTestConnection` method (#82, #84)

Bug fixes:

- Fix `Include Test Summary` and `Notify Repeated Failure` options being
  reversed when saving settings in the UI (#63)
- Change `.getPreviousBuild()` to allow for higher concurrency (#70)
- Solve `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError` when running unit tests (#82, #83)
- Adding ability for environment variables and parameters (#31, #80, #89)

    commit) (#30, #44, #45)

  notifications use the color of the last build result (#43)
