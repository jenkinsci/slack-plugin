- Stability: [![Build Status][jenkins-status]][jenkins-builds]
- Slack: [![Slack Signup][slack-badge]][slack-signup] (click to sign up)

Provides Jenkins notification integration with Slack or Slack compatible
applications like [RocketChat][rocketchat] and [Mattermost][mattermost].

# Install Instructions for Slack

1. Get a Slack account: https://slack.com/
2. Configure the Jenkins integration:
   https://my.slack.com/services/new/jenkins-ci
3. Install this plugin on your Jenkins server.
4. Configure it in your Jenkins job (and optionally as global configuration) and
   **add it as a Post-build action**.

### Install Instructions for Slack compatible application

1. Log into Slack compatible application.
2. Create a Webhook (it may need to be enabled in system console) by visiting
   Integrations.
3. You should now have a URL with a token.  Something like
   `https://mydomain.com/hooks/xxxx` where `xxxx` is the integration token and
   `https://mydomain.com/hooks/` is the `Base URL`.
4. Install this plugin on your Jenkins server.
5. Configure it in your Jenkins job (and optionally as global configuration) and
   **add it as a Post-build action**.

# Security

Use Jenkins Credentials and a credential ID to configure the Slack integration
token. It is a security risk to expose your integration token using the previous
*Integration Token* setting.

Create a new ***Secret text*** credential:

![image][img-secret-text]


Select that credential as the value for the ***Integration Token Credential
ID*** field:

![image][img-token-credential]

# Bot user option

This plugin supports sending notifications via bot users. You can enable bot
user support from both global and project configurations. If the notification
will be sent to a user via direct message, default integration sends it via
@slackbot, you can use this option if you want to send messages via a bot user.
You need to provide credentials of the bot user for integration token
credentials to use this feature.

Bot user option is not supported, if you use Base Url for a Slack compatible
application.
