## 1.8.1 release notes

This is a backport release which backports features originally intended for
slack-2.0 release.  This is meant as a nice fix for people missing critical
bugs.  Thanks [@Nooba](https://github.com/Nooba/) for taking the time to
backport all of the changes.  Since new features listed here will also be
included in the slack-2.0 release I'm not going to bother mentioning them in the
slack-2.0 release at all.

    \#81)

    plugin.  This includes the folder and the project in the notification (#61)

    easier to understand if it is the first or repeated failure in a build (#77)
